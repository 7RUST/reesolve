# reesolve (ree)
![release](https://github.com/junnlikestea/reesolve/workflows/release/badge.svg)
[![Build status](https://github.com/junnlikestea/reesolve/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/junnlikestea/reesolve/actions)

Fetches A/AAAA Ipv4/6 and CNAME records. These seem to 
be the records I'm frequently after, why not write a tool for it?


### Installation
Precompiled binaries for Reesolve are available in the [releases](https://github.com/junnlikestea/reesolve/releases) 
tab. Just pick your platform and extract the archive that contains the binary.

## Building it yourself 
If you want to build it yourself you will need to install Rust, you can get the
[official installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) from the Rust website.

To build Reesolve:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/junnlikestea/reesolve
$ cd reesolve
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/ree --version
```

### Usage

**Providing input**

You can pass in a file containing hostnames using the `-i` flag.
```
ree -i hosts.txt

```
or from `stdin`
```
cat hosts.txt | ree
```
or with output from other tools
```
vita -d hackerone.com | ree
```

**Using a custom list of resolvers**

By default Reesolve will use CloudFlare and Google public nameservers, but if you 
would like to change that, use the `-r` flag. These can be Ipv4 or Ipv6 Addresses
but Reesolve assumes they're using port `53`. 
```
ree -i hosts.txt -r resolvers.txt
```

**Changing the timeout**

The default timeout is `5` seconds, if you would like to change that use the `-t`
flag.
```
ree -i hosts.txt -t 15
```

**Print to stdout instead of an output file** 

If you would rather the output to go to stdout you can use the `--stdout` flag. This makes
it easier if you want to pipe the output into tools like `jq`
```json
junn:~$ echo example.com | ree --stdout | jq

[
  {
    "query": "example.com.",
    "name": "example.com.",
    "ip": "2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946",
    "type": "AAAA",
    "ttl": 21240,
    "is_wildcard": false
  },
  {
    "query": "example.com.",
    "name": "example.com.",
    "ip": "93.184.216.34",
    "type": "A",
    "ttl": 21444,
    "is_wildcard": false
  },
  {
    "query": "example.com.",
    "response_code": "No Error"
  }
]

```

**Changing the output format**

reesolve currently supports two output file formats `.json` (default) and 
`.csv` to select a specific output format use the `-f` flag.
```
junn:~$ ree -i hosts.txt -f csv
```

**Changing the output path or filename**

By default Reesolve will write all results as json, to an output file named `records.json`
in the current directory. However, if you would like to change the path and filename
you could do so with the `-o` flag.
```
junn:~$ ree -i hosts.txt -o some/path/filename
```

**The output format**

Reesolve will write the results to an output file by default. If you would like 
more output formats supported feel free to raise an issue.
```json
[
  {
    "name": "hackerone.com.",
    "ip": "104.16.99.52",
    "type": "A",
    "ttl": 300,
    "is_wildcard": false
  },
  {
    "name": "hackerone.com.",
    "ip": "2606:4700::6810:6334",
    "type": "AAAA",
    "ttl": 300,
    "is_wildcard": false
  }
]
```

**Filtering the output for a specific host** 

If you want to quickly check all results for a particular host, you could do something like:
```json
junn:~$ ree -i hosts.txt --stdout | jq -r '.[] | select(.query=="docs.hackerone.com.")'

 {
  "query": "docs.hackerone.com.",
  "name": "hacker0x01.github.io.",
  "ip": "185.199.111.153",
  "type": "A",
  "ttl": 3599,
  "is_wildcard": false
}
{
  "query": "docs.hackerone.com.",
  "name": "hacker0x01.github.io.",
  "ip": "185.199.108.153",
  "type": "A",
  "ttl": 3599,
  "is_wildcard": false
}
{
  "query": "docs.hackerone.com.",
  "name": "hacker0x01.github.io.",
  "ip": "185.199.110.153",
  "type": "A",
  "ttl": 3599,
  "is_wildcard": false
}
{
  "query": "docs.hackerone.com.",
  "name": "hacker0x01.github.io.",
  "ip": "185.199.109.153",
  "type": "A",
  "ttl": 3599,
  "is_wildcard": false
}
{
  "query": "docs.hackerone.com.",
  "name": "hacker0x01.github.io.",
  "type": "CNAME",
  "ttl": 224,
  "is_wildcard": false
}

```

**How can I tell what's going on?**

If you would like some more verbose output for debugging purposes, you can use the `-v` flag. 
There are different levels of verbosity ranging from noisy to informational, most of the
time I just use `info`. This is all printing to stderr, so it won't be captured
in the results.
* `info`: General information like how many results each source returned.
* `debug`: Lots and lots of information about what's going on under the hood.
```
junn:~$ ree -i hosts.txt -r resolvers.txt -v info
```

### Panic messages!
reesolve uses [trust-dns](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns) under the hood
and there is an [open issue](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/issues/1232) referring 
to this very error. These panics don't actually affect the output of reesolve, until
the issue has been fixed in trust-dns they will still occur when running the tool.
```
junn@void:~/reesolve/target/release$ ./ree -i hosts.txt -t 15 -c 100

```

### Common error - Too many open files
Reesolve uses tokio under the hood. If you encounter an error 
similar to *"Too many open files"* it means that there isn't enough available file descriptors on 
your system for the amount of tokio tasks being spawned. You can fix this by increasing the hard and soft limits. 
There are lots of different guides available to increase the limits 
[but here is one for linux](https://www.tecmint.com/increase-set-open-file-limits-in-linux/). 


### A note on tuning the concurrency
Reesolve will limit itself to `200` concurrent and parallel tasks, you can change this using
the `-c` flag. 

```
junn:~$ ree -i hosts.txt -c 500
```
